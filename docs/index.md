# CNV_SV module
The [cnv_sv module](https://github.com/hydra-genetics/cnv_sv) consists of a collection of tools calling larger structural genomic aberrations in DNA. Most tools use aligned `.bam` files as input, but many tools also make use of small variants calls in the form of a `.vcf` file.

We are an organization/community with the goal of making [snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) pipeline development easier, faster, a bit more structured and of higher quality.

We do this by providing [snakemake modules](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/snakefiles/modularization.html#modules) that can be combined to create a complete analysis or included in already existing pipelines. All modules are subjected to extensive testing to make sure that new releases doesn't unexpectedly break existing pipeline or deviate from guidelines and best practices on how to write code.
